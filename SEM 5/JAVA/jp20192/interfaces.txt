Interface
---------

1) Interface is an essentially abstract class whose all data members are by default "final" and all function members are by default "abstract".

2) Inferface can be inherited by a class using "implements" keyword.

3) A class can implement ( inherit ) multiple interfaces. So multiple inheritance is supported in JAVA using interfaces only.

4) Interface cannot have constructors.

5) Interface may inherit another interface using "extends" keyword.
