classpath
---------

classpath is an environmental variable which informs JVM about path of the classes.
By default, if classpath is not set then current folder is the classpath.

Classpath can be set as follows

set classpath=e:\xyz

Multiple classpaths canb be set by seperating with semicolon(;)

e.g.
set classpath=e:\xyz;e:\xyz1;

To set classpath to current folder, we set to dot (.)
e.g.
set classpath=.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Package
-------
package is used to classify or group class files.

class can be made member of package by adding following following statement on the top of Java file

package p1;

if class is the member of any package then it can only be accessed with package name as follows:

p1.abc

In this case, JVM will first try to find a folder with same name as that of package at classpath and then will find class file in that folder.

package name is usually same as the folder name.
