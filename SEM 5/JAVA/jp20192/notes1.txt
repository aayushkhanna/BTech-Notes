1. class definition is not terminated by semicolon(;)
2. members of class are not private by default
3. we can make members private using private keyword.
4. objects are created at runtime using new keyword only.
5. we can write any number of classes in one Java file. Compiler will create byte code (class files) for all classes.
6. We can only execute class file which has main method of following syntax
public static void main(String s[])
{
  
}

7. class data members (numeric) are by default initialized to zero. We can also initialize data memebrs at the time of their declaration.

8. Every class has a buil-in hidden default constructor which can only be called when there is no explicit constructor created in the class.
