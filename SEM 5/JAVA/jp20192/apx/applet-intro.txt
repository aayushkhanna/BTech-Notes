Applet
------
Applet is a Java program which can be embeded in a web page and run on any Java enabled browsers.

Applet can be tested in a utility known as appletviewer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To create applet, we need to create a public class which will import java.applet package and inherit Applet class.

public class abc extends Applet
{

}

Applet has following life cycle:

1. initialization
2. start
3. paint
4. stop
6. destroy

We cannot use System.out.print/println to draw anything on Applet.
